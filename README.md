# Programming Study Notes Repository
This repository is a collection of notes, guides, and references that I've wrote and compiled while studying different Software Engineering topics. It doesn't cover *every* topic, but serves as a hub of information sourced from various sources like courses, documentation, and the internet.

## Repository Structure
- The repository is organized by topic, with each directory corresponding to a concept or module.
- Some topics may contain subfolders expanding on the theme with practical examples or sub-concepts.
- **Languages Used:** Most code examples (especially in DSA) are written in Java for consistency and readability.
- The notes are in markdown format. Since they've been written using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) software they might use specific plugin features that aren't available outside it.
  
## How to Use This Repository
- **Navigate by Topic:** Each folder is named according to the main study concept I've approached, making it easy to locate specific topics. You may use this repository as a supplement resource to your study.

Whether you're reviewing, practicing, or learning something new - feel free to explore, experiment, and use this repository to strengthen your knowledge as you follow along with me in this journey!
