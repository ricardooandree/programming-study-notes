> This page has an index of OOP concepts explored in Java.

### Index 
[[OOP Core Pillars]]
- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

[[OOP Fundaments - Classes, Objects and Methods]]
- Defining and instantiating classes
- Constructors and destructors
- Instance variables/methods vs. class (static) variables/methods (static vs non-static variables and methods, static blocks and initialization order, why static methods cannot be overridden - hiding instead)
- Access modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Hash code, equals, to string, getters/setters, base object methods
- Data types and generic types
- Passing by reference or value
- Streams and arrow functions and lambda expressions

[[Error Handling & Exception Management]]
- Check vs. unchecked exceptions
- Try-catch-finally blocks
- Custom exceptions and how to create them
- Throwing and propagating exceptions (throws keyword)

[[Input & Output - Console and Files]]

[[Object Lifecycle & Memory Management]]
- Object creation (new keyword)
- Garbage collector and finalize()
- Stack vs. Heap memory allocation
- Shallow vs. Deep Copy
- Objects cloning and copying

[[SOLID Principles]]
[[GRASP Principles]]
[[Unit Testing - JUnit]]


Extra
- Object immutability (benefits, how to design immutable classes, final keyword usage for immutability) 
- Serialization & Deserialization (why serialization is needed, serializable interface in java, transient keyword)
- Method references and lambda expressions (functional OOP)
- Object oriented databases & persistence (ORMs - object-relational mapping, hibernate and JPA)
